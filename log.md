# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## 2021

### Day 1: 13th October Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I learned very basic stuff in JavaScript such as variables, comments, operators, conditionals etc.

### Day 2: 14th October Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the DOM, strategies to handle script loading (async, defer, DOMContendLoaded, etc.). And most importantly: 

"NOT TO USE INLINE JAVASCRIPT HANDLERS"

### Day 3: 15th October Friday

**Today's Progress**: I worked a HTML and CSS project today just to repolish my skills as I am learning JavaScript. 

The project is a Tribute page but unlike others this is a tribute for a programming language, **C**.

**Link to Work**: [an4s911.github.io/tribute-page-c](https://an4s911.github.io/tribute-page-c). It is not responsive, but I am planning on doing that soon.

### Day 4: 16th October Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the `style` property for DOM objects in JS. And also by following the MDN docs I made a number guessing game with just HTML and JS (No styling).

**Thoughts**: While making the game learned about `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` functions that are available built-in to browsers I guess.

### Day 5: 17th Ocotober Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Understood the 2 types of errors, syntax errors and logical errors (or bugs as we call it).

**Thoughts**: Syntax errors are quite easy to tackle and fix becuase it provides an error message which can be looked up in a documentation or some online platform for a solution. 

But the logical errors could end up being a bit complicated. It could take some time to debug the problem (might take even hours or days).

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
